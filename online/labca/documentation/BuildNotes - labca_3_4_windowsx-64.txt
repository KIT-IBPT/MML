Goal: Build labCA 3.4 for 64 bit windows.

Tools: See 'build_baseR3.14.12.2.txt'

Download from: http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~strauman/labca/index.html
  labca_3_4.tgz
  Size: 477 KB (488,643 bytes)

Copy to c:\epics to be in parallel with base

What's inside?
C:\epics\R3.14.12.2\other>bsdtar -tf labca_3_4.tgz > list_labca_3_4.txt
See .txt file

Unpack archive:
C:\epics\R3.14.12.2\other>bsdtar -xf labca_3_4.tgz
  labca_3_4
  Size:      1.32 MB (1,390,545 bytes)
  Contains:  319 files, 24 folders

Top-level folders are
  configure
  CVS
  documentation
  ezca
  gule
  matlab
  testing

I deleted all CVS directories (10).
I deleted one junk file in \configure (.#RELEASE1.11).
  labca_3_4
  Size:       1.31 MB (1,381,485 bytes)
  Contains:   277 file, 14 folders

What's in \configure?
  CONFIG
  CONFIG_APP
  Makefile
  RELEASE
  RELEASE.linux-x86_64
  RELEASE.win32-x86
  RULES
  RULES.ioc
  RULES_DIRS
  RULES_TOP

Makefile at top of application tree defines
TOP = .

Instructions for building are in \documentation\manual.pdf.

Two files in \configure may need to be edited.
I check or set the following:
CONFIG
  MAKEFOR=MATLAB
  CONFIG_USE_CTRLC=YES
RELEASE
   (I put labca in parallel with epics/base, so I use a different EPICS_BASE)
   (Steve's EPICS_BASE EPICS_BASE=$(TOP)/../../base)
  EPICS_BASE=$(TOP)/../base
   My matlab directory is located here as well
  MATLABDIR=C:\matlab\R2012a
   This seems to be the directory located in
   $(MATLABDIR)/extern/lib/
  MATLIB_SUBDIR=win64/microsoft

I added these three lines at the end of RELEASE

Note that by not setting INSTALL_LOCATION_APP in RELEASE, I'm accepting
the default installation location, with is \labca_3_4 itself.
I changed the name of the labca directory from labca_3_4 to labca


Ready to build.

Environment variable:
EPICS_HOST_ARCH=windows-x64

Set up compile environment:
D:\>cmd /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" amd64
Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 x64 tools.
Again, this can be done from the Windows command
All Programs
  Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
    Visual Studio Tools
      Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt (2010)

Build:
C:\epics\R3.14.12.2\other\labca_3_4>make > make_labca_3_4.txt

Done.
Compile time was 34 seconds, starting 5/5/2012 4:02 PM.
No messages were sent to command line.
See make_labca_3_4.txt for details.
Move make_labca_3_4.txt out of labca_3_4 folder.
  labca_3_4
  Size:      2.96 MB (3,111,817 bytes)
  Contains:  451 files, 32 folders

The build created the following directories in \labca_3_4
  bin
  doc
  html
  jar
  lib

Does it work?

To test, I must have in my windows path:
c:\epics\base\bin\windows-x64 (added in building of epics base)
c:\epics\labca\bin\windows-x64
(Steve's PATH additions
C:\epics\R3.14.12.2\base\bin\windows-x64
C:\epics\R3.14.12.2\other\labca_3_4\bin\windows-x64)

and I must have in my matlab path:
c:\epics\labca\bin\windows-x64\labca
(Steve's MATLABPATH addition
C:\epics\R3.14.12.2\other\labca_3_4\bin\windows-x64\labca)

In matlab,
>> lcaGet('GTL-GT1:Charge')
Initializing labCA Release '$Name: labca_3_4 $'...

ans =

  490.4508

Yes, it works.

(I had already renamed my labca, but if I had not, follow Steve's instruction)
Rename \labca_3_4 -> \labca,
  in C:\epics\R3.14.12.2\other.
