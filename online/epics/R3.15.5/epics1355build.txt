This documents the building of epics release 13_5_5 on my pc.  For this compilation I have used the notes on the epics site as a guidline.  In particular I have used the main epics page
http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/win32.php
and a link to another
http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/tech-talk/2015/msg01582.php
with a sample of a batch file I will base my file from.

rem This file sets up for an EPICS windows-x64 build
rem  I will not need this as this is already set as an environment variable
set EPICS_HOST_ARCH=windows-x64

rem These are the locations of "make", "re2c", "Perl", and EPICS base.  Prepend them to the PATH.
rem  I will create a path with the minimum required windows path and then add my paths for perl, gmake within the perl distribution, and my epics location
set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\re2c;C:\Perl64\bin;H:\epics\base\bin\windows-x64;%PATH%

rem Execute the Visual Studio batch file for 64-bit builds
rem  Instead I will use the appropriate command for Visual Studio Community 2015
%comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" amd64
rem  note that %comspec% launches the command for cmd.exe
rem  note that the /k option tells command to keep the window open

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64

rem  this suggested file is then executed by the following command, but I should be able to just execute the entire set of commands in one batch file
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /K C:\EPICS\setup_epics_vs2010_win64.bat


Required Software

Operating system native compiler
In this case I am using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 (I likely could also use 2017, but I already have 2015 loaded on my machine.  Note that the system needs to be loaded as a custom installation in order to get the Visual C++ compiler and the successor to the Visual Studio Software Development Kit (SDK).  This is done by selecting
Common Tools -> Visual Studio Extensibility Tools Update 3
in the installation process.
Note that if Visual Studio is already installed with insufficent tools installed, from Control Panel -> All Control Panel Items -> Programs and Features, navigate to Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 with Updates, right click and run modify.
The script to run for the native compiler can then be found from
Windows->All Programs->Visual Studio 2015->Visual Studio Tools->Windows Desktop Command Prompts->VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt
This shortcut starts in the directory
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\"
and runs the command
%comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" amd64
(Note that %comspec% is an environment variable set to C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe)

Perl
I use Strawberry Perl.  One advantage of this installation is that it includes gmake (GNU Make 4.2.1).  EPICS installation says that make 3.81 or later is required, so I will try to see if this make works.
Note that Strawberry Perl by default installs three directories in the path:
C:\Strawberry\c\bin;C:\Strawberry\perl\site\bin;C:\Strawberry\perl\bin;
I will include these three directories in my batch file.

Windows
On Windows7, the default paths seem to be
C:\Windows\System32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0
(Note that %SystemRoot% is an environment variable set to C:\Windows.)

EPICS
Download epics base 3.15.5 from
https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/base/index.php
Use 7-zip and unzip and untar files to
C:\epics\base_3_15_5

::
::
:: set environment variables
set EPICS_HOST_ARCH=windows-x64
set epicsInstall=C:\epics\base_3_15_5
set perl=C:\Strawberry
:: set path for windows
set PATH=%SystemRoot%\System32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\wbem;%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0;
:: add path for perl/gmake
set PATH=%PATH%;%perl%\c\bin;%perl%\perl\site\bin;%perl%\perl\bin;
:: add path for epics installation
set PATH=%PATH%;%epicsInstall%\bin\%EPICS_HOST_ARCH%
:: navigate to base directory (does not work after execution of vcvarsall.bat)
cd /D %epicsInstall%
:: set ms visual studio 2015 community environment
::   note that comspec finds the command line prompt
::   /k tells the command prompt to stay open upon completion of command
%comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" amd64
:: gmake clean, gmake to build epics
